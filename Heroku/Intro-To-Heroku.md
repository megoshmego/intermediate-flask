- [Speaker] All right, so next up,
0:05
we're gonna talk about deploying our Flask applications.
0:08
Right now, everything's running on local host,
0:11
we are not sharing these with people online,
0:13
we're not deploying them,
0:15
actually hosting them somewhere that anybody can access.
0:18
And that's a really important thing
0:19
that we wanna be able to do.
0:21
So there's lots of ways of deploying lots of services
0:24
that you can use to host your application.
0:26
One that we're gonna use for now is called Heroku.
0:29
Heroku, is a really popular tool.
0:33
It supports all sorts of different languages,
0:35
you can use it to host a Python app like we are,
0:38
you can host a Node app on there,
0:39
you can host a Ruby on Rails app.
0:42
It makes it relatively easy.
0:44
I should warn you, first up front,
0:46
something is going to go wrong,
0:48
on pretty much every application you're trying to deploy.
0:51
It's just part of the,
0:52
that's the nature of deploying.
0:54
What we're trying to do is take an application
0:56
that we have running locally on our machine,
0:58
configure it for production,
1:00
and then install it
1:02
or send it to one of Heroku's servers,
1:05
and have it work on Heroku server
1:08
and respond to requests and do everything we want.
1:11
But it's kind of this difficult process
1:13
because we are installing it
1:14
or sending it to a different server,
1:17
we need to be able to make sure,
1:18
our database is correctly configured on Heroku.
1:22
We need to make sure all the dependencies are installed
1:25
and available in the correct versions on Heroku.
1:28
There are other things we need to configure,
1:29
like the secret key for our Flask application
1:32
that we want to configure on Heroku.
1:35
So it is somewhat involved.
1:37
However, Heroku still makes it a lot easier
1:39
than trying to do this with some other tools.
1:42
Just be prepared for something to go wrong
1:44
and don't panic.
1:46
We'll talk about how we can try and fix things,
1:48
and common things that may go wrong.
1:50
Okay, so what I'm going to do is deploy this application
1:54
that we've made,
1:55
it's very simple, it really doesn't have much going on.
1:58
You can log in and out.
2:00
We're using a database,
2:01
we have SQLAlchemy,
2:03
we've got WTForms,
2:04
I've got bcrypt, so that we can log in.
2:07
I can create Tweets,
2:08
and they're associated with my user.
2:10
So I think I was DogFan3.
2:12
I can delete them if I created them,
2:14
and I can log out and sign up and all that stuff.
2:18
Alright, so I have it running on localhost, of course,
2:21
what we need to do next is figure out
2:23
how we get this on Heroku.
2:25
All right, so let's talk a little bit more about Heroku.
2:27
It is a platform as a service.
2:30
It's a company
2:31
where basically their whole product,
2:34
is offering a platform for you to host your applications.
2:37
And they try and make it as easy as possible
2:39
for you to get your applications up on there.
2:41
Now it is a paid product
2:43
that a lot of companies do use.
2:46
And Heroku charges pretty significant amount of money,
2:50
as you scale up and you get a lot more users
2:52
and requests and data and storage.
2:54
But they have a free tier,
2:56
and that's what we'll be working with.
2:57
All you need to do is set up an account.
2:59
And you won't even have to add a credit card.
3:02
So let's start with installing Heroku.
3:06
The first thing we need to do is make sure
3:07
that we have Homebrew installed on your computer.
3:10
So if you don't,
3:12
follow the instructions to install Homebrew.
3:15
You can also just check if it's installed.
3:17
If you go to our terminal here,
3:18
I'll stop my server.
3:20
If you type brew -v,
3:24
if you see something rather than command not found,
3:27
we know we've got Homebrew installed.
3:29
Then the next step, is to sign up for an account on Heroku.
3:33
So click this link, it will take you to Heroku,
3:36
we'll click Sign up.
3:37
I've already done this,
3:38
but you'll need to register with an email and a password.
3:41
I think you need to verify it, the email that is,
3:44
so don't don't register with a fake email.
3:47
And then when that finishes,
3:48
we have one more step
3:49
just to get Heroku installed on our machine.
3:52
The Heroku command line interface.
3:54
So this is why we need Homebrew,
3:56
run this command brew install heroku/brew/heroku.
4:01
This will give us a tool that we can use in our terminal
4:05
to deploy code using special commands.
4:07
We'll get a command called Heroku push.
4:10
We'll get a command that allows us
4:11
to update things on Heroku, on their servers,
4:15
but it's all through the command line.
4:17
So install this, run this command,
4:19
it may take a while just a heads up.
4:22
Last time I did this was a couple months ago,
4:25
on a new machine, it took probably five-ish minutes.
4:29
Maybe it'll be faster for you.
4:30
But don't freak out if it does take a little while.
4:32
And the same goes for installing Homebrew,
4:34
if you don't have it installed already.
4:36
So go through these steps,
4:38
between this video and the next video
4:40
and then we'll talk about
4:41
what we actually need to do to deploy an app.
4:43
Also, I recommend that you keep the handouts open
4:47
when you're deploying.
4:48
You may not want to deploy right along with me,
4:50
at the moment as I'm typing this
4:52
and as you're watching the videos.
4:54
I think it will be easier if you just watch this,
4:56
see how it goes, see what goes wrong
4:58
or what doesn't go wrong.
4:59
And then when you're ready to deploy your own app,
5:02
pull up the handouts, just reference step by step,
5:05
what you need to do.
5:06
Because there are quite a few important steps,
5:08
and there's some syntax we haven't seen before.
5:11
So don't feel like you gotta do it right now
5:13
and memorize it all.
5:14
Ready, run these commands
5:15
and I'll see you in the next video.
5:17
