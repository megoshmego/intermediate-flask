Would you please evaluate the transcript I provide for its key terms, ideas, concepts and their defintions. Would you also please include the video title â€œConfiguring Profile and Runtime", the subsection title "Heroku", and the section title "Intermediate Flask"?

- [Instructor] So next step,
0:05
we're going to install a new server
0:07
that we want to use for our app only in production.
0:10
The server we've been using out of the box with Flask
0:12
is for development, and it's just not as efficient.
0:16
It's not a server that is production ready.
0:19
So we want to configure our app to
0:22
use a production ready server on Heroku.
0:25
The particular server we'll be using
0:26
technically it's called gunicorn
0:30
for however many years, I've been referring it
0:32
referring to it as gunicorn, but I just Googled it.
0:37
It is definitely pronounced gunicorn.
0:39
So I've just learned that today,
0:41
fortunately, that doesn't impact how we use it.
0:44
We do need to install it.
0:45
So pip install gunicorn.
0:48
I'm gonna do that now.
0:50
Pip install.
0:51
I'm using my virtual environment.
0:53
As you can see here, I have a virtual environment
0:56
and then I'll need to freeze my requirements
0:58
or freeze pip and save to my requirements .txt.
1:02
So pip install gunicorn, just like that.
1:08
Okay, so that finished,
1:10
the next step is to make sure my requirements .txt
1:13
is completely up to date.
1:15
I'm going to have to send my code
1:18
over to Heroku, but I'm not going to include any
1:20
of the virtual environment stuff.
1:22
It's actually in my get ignore file.
1:24
My get ignore is completely ignoring venv.
1:27
And we will be using get
1:28
in order to send our code, or push our code to Heroku.
1:32
So that requirements.txt file is very important.
1:35
Pip freeze, and then requirements.txt.
1:39
Let's just look at it
1:41
make sure we see gunicorn and then all other dependencies.
1:43
So I've got B crypt, Flask B crypt.
1:47
We now need to add something called a Procfile
1:50
with a capital P, a Procfile is going to be used
1:53
by Heroku to determine what command will
1:56
be needed to actually start the server.
1:59
So we can have multiple different apps
2:01
in different languages that we want to deploy to Heroku,
2:04
and they will all start in different ways.
2:07
And the way that our server is going to be started
2:09
is with this line right here, gunicorn app, colon app.
2:14
So web colon, I just said, gunicorn,
2:17
gunicorn app colon app.
2:20
This is how you start up the gunicorn server.
2:23
If we were pushing a Ruby app made with rails,
2:25
we would have a different
2:26
command that we want Heroku to run.
2:29
And we put that in the Procfile.
2:31
If we were using node
2:32
and we had an express app, we have a different command here
2:35
but for our Python app, when we're using gunicorn
2:38
as our server, we'll just run this line
2:41
and we need to put it in a file called Procfile capital P.
2:45
There is no extension.
2:46
It's not .txt.
2:48
It's not .py it's just Procfile.
2:51
And we'll put this in the root of our directory.
2:54
So in the same place where our app .py is,
2:57
there we go, make sure it shows up
3:00
and let's take a look at it.
3:02
Cat Procfile.
3:04
Okay, we're in business there.
3:07
Now we have another configuration file called runtime.
3:10
And this one is a .txt file.
3:13
This is how we can tell Heroku exactly
3:15
what version of Python we want to use.
3:17
So we want to figure out exactly what version we're using
3:21
which you could just type Python.
3:23
I am in the virtual environment.
3:25
So I'm not going to do Python three, but just Python.
3:27
I can see I'm using 3.7.2.
3:30
If you're using something different, just take note.
3:32
And then in runtime.txt
3:34
we specify the exact version that we want Heroku to use.
3:38
So if you were writing a Python two app, for some reason
3:41
we need to make sure Heroku knows that
3:43
and it's not going to try and run it with Python three.
3:47
All right.
3:48
So now I've got that file.
3:49
Runtime.txt.
3:51
Let's take a look.
3:53
And it has Python 3.7.2 in there.
3:56
Okay, so I'm gonna stop here.
3:57
We have some basic configuration done.
4:00
These are files that Heroku is going to be looking for.
4:03
We also installed gunicorn.
4:05
We froze our requirements into requirements.txt,
4:09
next we're going to actually create our Heroku app
4:12
and push our code up.
4:13
But that won't be the end of the story.
4:15
We still have more to do, but that's coming up next.
