In this video, the instructor covers the concept of nested routes in RESTful APIs. Nested routes are used when dealing with multiple resources that have relationships with each other. The key points from the video are:

Nested Routes: Nested routes are used when one resource is associated with another resource. For example, if you have subreddits and posts, you may want to have a nested route to show the posts associated with a specific subreddit.

Avoid deep nesting: As a rule of thumb, avoid nesting your routes more than two resources deep. This helps in maintaining simplicity and readability of the URLs.

Flexibility: There's no strict rule for structuring nested routes. Depending on the requirements of your API, you may decide to include or exclude certain resource IDs in the URL.

An example of nested routes:

bash
Copy code
/subreddits/<sub_id>/posts
This example demonstrates how the posts are associated with a specific subreddit through the nested route structure.

Another example of nested routes for a Reddit-like API:

bash
Copy code
/posts/<post_id>/comments/<comment_id>
This example demonstrates how comments are associated with a specific post through the nested route structure.

Remember, these are not hard rules. They're just patterns to follow that make it easier to work with related resources in RESTful APIs. As you work with more APIs, you'll notice that many of them follow similar patterns, with some deviations based on specific requirements.
