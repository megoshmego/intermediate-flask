Course: Intermediate Python
Subsection: Restful JSON APIs

Key terms and concepts:

RESTful routes: REST (Representational State Transfer) is a standard for designing networked applications. It's a set of constraints applied to HTTP-based APIs that determine how resources should be created, read, updated, and deleted. RESTful routes follow a specific pattern that includes HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and specific URL structures.

API Examples: The video provides examples of popular APIs that follow RESTful conventions, such as Spotify, GitHub, and Stripe.

Spotify API: Allows users to perform CRUD operations on resources like playlists, but restricts certain actions like creating or deleting albums. The API follows RESTful conventions in its route structure.

GitHub API: Offers the ability to perform CRUD operations on repositories. The API follows RESTful conventions in its route structure.

Stripe API: A payment processing API that allows users to perform CRUD operations on resources like customers, products, and charges. The API follows RESTful conventions in its route structure.

Resource-specific actions: Not every resource will have all CRUD actions available. For example, some APIs might allow you to view a resource but not update or delete it. RESTful routes can be customized to support only the required actions for each resource.

The video teaches the RESTful pattern used for designing APIs and shows examples of popular APIs that follow this pattern. This pattern is used to build a RESTful JSON API and the viewers are encouraged to get comfortable with it.


Title: REST Examples

Concept: RESTful API design pattern

In the video, the presenter discusses RESTful API design patterns and provides examples from popular APIs like Spotify, GitHub, and Stripe. Here's a simple example demonstrating the key concepts using a hypothetical API for managing books:

Create a new book (POST):
Endpoint: /books
Request:
json
Copy code
{
  "title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
  "author": "J.D. Salinger"
}
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
  "author": "J.D. Salinger"
}
Get a list of all books (GET):
Endpoint: /books
Response:
json
Copy code
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
    "author": "J.D. Salinger"
  }
]
Get a specific book by ID (GET):
Endpoint: /books/1
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
  "author": "J.D. Salinger"
}
Update a book (PUT or PATCH):
Endpoint: /books/1
Request:
json
Copy code
{
  "title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
  "author": "Jerome David Salinger"
}
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
  "author": "Jerome David Salinger"
}
Delete a book (DELETE):
Endpoint: /books/1
Response: HTTP status code 204 No Content
This simple example demonstrates how a RESTful API for managing books could be designed using standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) and a consistent URL pattern. Note that not all resources need to support all operations, but when they do, following RESTful conventions makes the API more predictable and easier to use.
