Title: RESTful ToDo's API part II
Course: Intermediate Python
Section: Restful JSON API's
..

In this video, the instructor covers how to implement update and delete routes for a RESTful API using Python and Flask. The main concepts discussed in the video include:

Update route:
HTTP verbs: PUT and PATCH. PUT is used to update an entire resource, while PATCH is used to update a portion of a resource.
Implementing a route for a PATCH request to /todos/<ID>.
Updating the ToDo based on the data sent with the request using request.json.
Manually setting each field of the ToDo using the request data.
Timestamp: 0:15 - 6:57

Delete route:
Implementing a route for a DELETE request to /todos/<ID>.
Finding the ToDo to delete using ToDo.query.get_or_404(ID).
Deleting the ToDo using db.session.delete(ToDo) and committing the changes with db.session.commit().
Returning JSON with a message indicating the ToDo has been deleted.
Timestamp: 6:58 - 10:44

Throughout the video, the instructor demonstrates the implementation of the concepts using code examples and tests the API using Insomnia, a REST client. The video concludes with a brief mention of upcoming topics, such as using the API, testing, and nested routes.


Certainly! In the video titled "RESTful ToDo's API part II", the instructor demonstrates the implementation of update and delete routes for a ToDo's API within the "Intermediate Python" course, subsection "Restful JSON API's". Here's a simple breakdown of the concepts covered in the video:

Update Route (Using HTTP PATCH method): The instructor shows how to create a route to update a ToDo item. The route is defined using the PATCH method and an ID parameter to identify the ToDo item to be updated. The function updates the title and/or the completed status of the ToDo item based on the data sent in the request. 

Here's a simple demonstration:

python


@app.route('/todos/<int:todo_id>', methods=['PATCH'])
def update_todo(todo_id):
    todo = Todo.query.get_or_404(todo_id)
    todo.title = request.json.get('title', todo.title)
    todo.done = request.json.get('done', todo.done)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify(todo=todo.serialize())
Delete Route (Using HTTP DELETE method): The instructor explains how to create a route to delete a ToDo item. The route is defined using the DELETE method and an ID parameter to identify the ToDo item to be deleted. The function removes the ToDo item from the database and returns a message confirming the deletion. Here's a simple demonstration:

python

@app.route('/todos/<int:todo_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_todo(todo_id):
    todo = Todo.query.get_or_404(todo_id)
    db.session.delete(todo)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify(message="Deleted")
