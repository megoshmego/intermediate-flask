Title: Using our API with JS
Section: Intermediate Python
Subsection: Restful JSON API's

Key terms and concepts::

JSON API: A JSON API is an application programming interface that uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for exchanging data between a server and a client.
Flask app: Flask is a micro web framework for Python that allows you to build web applications easily.
HTML, JavaScript, and CSS: The core technologies used to build and style websites, with HTML providing the structure, JavaScript providing interactivity, and CSS providing styling.
Axios: A popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from the browser.
jQuery: A popular JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling and animation.
API request and response: The process of sending a request to an API and receiving a response containing the requested data.
Data attribute: A custom attribute that stores data in HTML elements, which can be easily accessed and manipulated with JavaScript and jQuery.
Demo 1: Creating a simple application that implements delete and update operations using the JSON API.

Demo 2: Using JavaScript and jQuery to interact with the Flask API and update the DOM in response to user actions, like clicking a delete button.

Demo 3: Storing and accessing data attributes in HTML elements, which can be used to store additional information, such as the ID of a to-do item, without displaying it to the user.

In the second half of the script, the instructor demonstrates how to delete a to-do item by sending a DELETE request using Axios. They create an async function called deleteTodo and use jQuery to get the ID of the to-do item being deleted. They then call Axios.delete with the URL /api/todos/{id}, which sends a DELETE request to the API to remove the to-do item from the database.

After the DELETE request has been made, they use jQuery to remove the actual to-do element from the DOM. They then challenge the viewers to add logic to toggle the to-do item's done status and send an API request using the PATCH route to update the item in the database.

The instructor wraps up the video by emphasizing that you can use this same approach to create a full single-page application or a standalone API that can be accessed by other applications. They also mention that many companies use this approach to create API servers that can be accessed by thousands of developers.
