Title: How to not Authenticate
Course: Intermediate Python
Section: Hashing and Log In

Key Terms and Concepts::

Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user.
Hashing: The process of converting data into a fixed-size string, which represents the original data. Hashing is used to ensure the integrity and security of data, especially in the context of passwords.
Salting: A technique used in conjunction with hashing to increase security. A random value (salt) is generated and combined with the password before hashing, making it harder for attackers to crack the password.
Bcrypt: A password-hashing algorithm designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making it more resistant to brute-force attacks.
SHA: Secure Hash Algorithm, a family of cryptographic hash functions used in various security applications.
MD5: Message-Digest Algorithm 5, a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value.
Bad Authentication Method:
The video demonstrates a bad way of implementing authentication where a user enters their username and password, and the system stores the password in plain text in the database. This method has several vulnerabilities:

Developers or employees with access to the database can see users' passwords.
Users often use the same password across multiple websites, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
If the database is hacked, attackers can access users' passwords easily.
The video demonstrates this bad authentication method using a simple Flask web application. The application accepts a username and password from the user, and directly stores the password in the database without any hashing or salting.

Recommended Demos:

Demonstration of how to implement password hashing and salting using bcrypt in a Flask application.
Demonstration of using a secure password storage library, such as Passlib, to handle password hashing and verification.
Demonstration of how to implement proper password reset functionality, rather than displaying the user's password directly.
