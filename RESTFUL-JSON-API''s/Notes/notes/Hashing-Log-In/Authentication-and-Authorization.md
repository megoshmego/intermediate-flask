Title: Authentication and Authorization
Course: Intermediate Python
Section: Hashing and Log In

Key Terms and Concepts:

Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user based on their credentials (e.g., email and password or username and password). It allows the application to confirm that a user is who they claim to be.

Authorization: The process of determining what a user is allowed to do or access within an application. It deals with permissions and restrictions once a user is authenticated.

Hashing: A process that transforms input data (e.g., a password) into a fixed-size string of bytes, usually a hash code. It is a one-way function, meaning it's very difficult (or practically impossible) to reverse-engineer the original data from the hash code. This helps in securely storing sensitive data, like passwords.

Hashing Algorithms: Algorithms used to perform the hashing process, such as SHA-256, MD5, or Bcrypt.

Bcrypt: A password hashing algorithm designed to be slow and resource-intensive, making it resistant to brute-force attacks. It will be used to implement authentication and authorization in Flask.

Demos:

A demo showcasing a bad way to implement authentication (to be shown in the next video), to highlight why it's not a good idea and the importance of using secure methods.

A demo implementing secure authentication and authorization in Flask using the Bcrypt algorithm. This will involve registering, logging in, and logging out users, as well as implementing permissions and restrictions based on user roles.

Remember, the next video will demonstrate a bad way to implement authentication to show why it's not recommended. Make sure to follow the subsequent videos for the proper way to implement authentication and authorization using Bcrypt.

Title: Intro to Hashing
Course: Intermediate Python
Section: Hashing and Log In

Key Terms and Concepts:

Hashing: A process of taking some input data and mapping it to a fixed-size output.
Hash function: A function that takes input data of any size and returns a fixed-size output.
Deterministic: A property of hash functions where the same input always produces the same output.
Cryptographic Hash function: A special subset of hash functions used in cryptography with additional requirements, such as being a one-way function.
One-way function: A function where, given the output, it is computationally infeasible to determine the input.
In the video, the speaker explains the concept of hashing and its importance in storing passwords securely. They emphasize that storing passwords in plain text is a terrible idea. Instead, they recommend using a hash function to transform the password into a fixed-size output that cannot be reverse-engineered to obtain the original password. This hashed password is then stored in the database. When a user logs in, the entered password is hashed using the same function, and the output is compared to the stored hashed password to verify if they match.

Demos::

Implementing a simple hash function to understand the concept.
Using cryptographic hash functions for password storage and authentication.
Comparing input and hashed passwords during login.
The video covers the general concept of hash functions, their determinism, and the additional requirements of cryptographic hash functions. It also provides examples to illustrate the properties of one-way functions and their application in secure password storage.
