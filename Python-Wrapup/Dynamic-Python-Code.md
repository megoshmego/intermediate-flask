Key Terms, Ideas, and Concepts:

Python: A high-level, easy-to-read, and strongly-typed programming language.
Standard Library: Python's extensive library of built-in modules.
Dynamic Language: A programming language that allows the creation of methods, classes, or other constructs during runtime.
Dynamically Typed: A language that allows variables to change their type during runtime.
Strongly Typed: A language that does not automatically coerce data types when performing operations, like adding a number to a string.
setattr(): A built-in Python function that sets the value of a named attribute of an object.
Definitions:

Python: A popular, high-level programming language known for its readability and extensive standard library.
Standard Library: A collection of modules that come bundled with Python, providing functionality for a wide range of tasks.
Dynamic Language: A language that allows developers to create, modify or delete constructs like classes, methods, or functions during the execution of a program.
Dynamically Typed: A characteristic of programming languages where variables can change their type during the execution of the program.
Strongly Typed: A characteristic of programming languages that enforce strict rules on mixing data types during operations and do not automatically convert between types.
setattr(): A built-in Python function that allows developers to set the value of a named attribute of an object dynamically. The syntax is: setattr(object, attribute_name, value).
