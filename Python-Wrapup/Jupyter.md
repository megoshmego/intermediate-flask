Would you please evaluate the transcript I provide for it's key terms, ideas, concepts and their defintions. Would you also please include the video title "Jupyter", the subsection title "Python Wrap-up", and the section title "Intermediate Flask".

- [Instructor] Lastly, one of the most popular tools
0:06
in the world of Python is something called Jupyter.
0:09
Jupyter is a really cool tool
0:11
it's also kind of hard to encapsulate in a single sentence.
0:15
It works in a bunch of languages,
0:17
but we're gonna talk about Python and Jupyter.
0:20
It's a way of creating these interactive documents
0:24
that run code, that where you can edit code,
0:26
you can tweak code, you can show the output of code,
0:29
you can create charts,
0:30
you can add documentation
0:32
and you can run it in a webpage.
0:34
So you can mix in drawings and pieces of code,
0:37
documentation, explanations.
0:40
There's even ways of making Jupyter collaborative
0:42
and it's a great way of creating a report
0:45
to share with people or a tutorial,
0:48
on how to do something in Python,
0:50
where it's actually interactive.
0:51
Somebody can open it up,
0:53
publish it on the web even
0:54
and you can share it with people
0:56
and people can run the Python, the actual code blocks.
0:59
They can tweak them in the browser.
1:01
I'll just show you a quick version of how this works.
1:04
Here's a simple example.
1:06
So I have a file in my terminal.
1:09
Where are you?
1:10
Which is called...
1:11
Let me close this down.
1:16
is called key-exchange.ipynb interactive Python notebook.
1:22
And there's a couple of different ways of using Jupyter,
1:24
but one option is to use something called Jupyter notebook
1:28
from your command line to starts up a server
1:30
and then I can view a different Python files
1:34
that are available in that directory where I ran it.
1:36
So if I tried to open up just a regular old Python file,
1:40
it just opens up a web interface where I can edit my file.
1:44
But if I go to one of the interactive files,
1:48
one of the notebooks, this is what I get.
1:51
So this is something that we've pre-written here.
1:53
It's a walkthrough of how an algorithm works,
1:57
the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.
1:59
And we've got texts and markdown stuff here
2:03
that you can edit and change at any point
2:06
but we also have code blocks
2:08
and it's broken up pieces at a time.
2:10
So import statements, then we're calling some stuff,
2:14
we're printing something out.
2:15
You can see the value is printed right there.
2:18
So I could actually add something in
2:20
like print 100 plus 300
2:23
and then I can run it and we get 400.
2:26
So I'm going to undo that and go back to what I had here.
2:31
Okay.
2:32
We also have other pieces of code.
2:34
This is a simple example,
2:35
there's nothing really to show you.
2:37
There's not a chart generated,
2:39
but then I can run the entire thing.
2:41
And we get all of the outputs from each cell
2:44
or each block of code.
2:46
But here's an example from Jupyter's webpage.
2:49
This is something called Jupiter lab,
2:51
it's one of their newer products they have.
2:54
But anyway, it is talking about something called
2:57
The Lorenz Differential Equations, who knows?
3:00
No idea what it is,
3:01
but this is a great way to learn it,
3:03
as you can see we've got examples of code.
3:05
So they're showing before you start,
3:07
we need to import some libraries.
3:08
So here's the code.
3:10
We explore the Lorenz system of Differential Equations,
3:13
blah,blah, blah.
3:14
I shouldn't say blah, blah, blah.
3:15
It's probably very important stuff,
3:17
but I can run one cell at a time and step through it.
3:20
So if I hit this play button, now it moves down to here.
3:23
The blue arrow or indicator shows what we're currently on.
3:27
I can hit play, keep going down.
3:30
This is going to make me an interactive plot.
3:32
So it takes a moment,
3:33
but it is importing some data it looks like and using it.
3:38
And now I have this interactive plot I can play around with.
3:41
So this is all in the browser.
3:43
It's pretty fancy stuff,
3:45
and especially in the world of data science
3:47
where you are generating some sort of report
3:49
or results or something you want to share,
3:51
or even just notes.
3:52
This is at least my experience working
3:54
with data science instructors who are teaching Bootcamps,
3:58
they'll create notes for their course in Jupyter notebooks
4:02
so that a student can download it
4:04
or run it in their browser.
4:05
They can play around with things,
4:06
they can tweak things.
4:08
So I could, you know, try manipulating some of these values.
4:11
I have no idea what any of this means,
4:14
but let's say I go with a 100 here,
4:18
I have a 90 point no and then rerun it.
4:22
Let's go back to 50 and see if anything changes.
4:27
I really don't know if anything changed,
4:30
but it is being used to generate what we see here.
4:34
This code is actually running
4:36
and then I can continue to step through this.
4:39
I can tweak things.
4:40
There are other tools you can use
4:42
where you can create a live notebook
4:44
where you can collaborate kind of like,
4:46
a Google Doc or something
4:48
where people can contribute
4:49
and write notes and comments.
4:51
So I've been in courses where we needed
4:54
to turn in work as a Jupyter notebook,
4:56
and we would get feedback based off the code
4:59
directly in the same notebook.
5:01
Anyway, it's pretty cool.
5:02
And I would be doing you a disservice
5:05
if I didn't mention the existence
5:07
of Jupyter at the very list,
5:08
let's get to the end here,
5:09
it looks like we're gonna have a plot somewhere.
5:12
Are we gonna have a plot?
5:12
There it is, we've got a histogram, this chart.
5:16
I don't even know what,
5:18
what it's actually plotting,
5:19
but we've got something.
5:20
Anyway.
5:21
So that is a crash, not even a crash course,
5:24
a brief intro to Jupyter notebooks.
