Key Terms, Ideas, Concepts, and Definitions:

Jupyter: A popular tool in the world of Python, allowing for the creation of interactive documents that can run code, edit code, display code output, create charts, and add documentation, all within a webpage.

Interactive documents: Documents that contain code, charts, and documentation, which can be edited, run, and shared with others. These documents are often used for reports, tutorials, or teaching materials in fields like data science.

Jupyter Notebook: A web-based interface that allows users to create, edit, and run Jupyter interactive documents. It can be launched from the command line and supports multiple languages, including Python.

Code blocks: Sections of code within a Jupyter Notebook that can be executed independently, allowing users to step through the document, running and tweaking code as needed.

Markdown: A lightweight markup language used in Jupyter Notebooks for formatting text, including headings, lists, and links.

Collaboration: Jupyter Notebooks can be shared and collaborated on in real-time, similar to Google Docs, allowing multiple users to contribute, write notes, and add comments.

Jupyter Lab: A newer product from the Jupyter project, offering an integrated development environment for working with notebooks, code, and data.

Example: The transcript provided includes an example that demonstrates how Jupyter Notebook works, walking users through a Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm and showcasing the ability to edit, run, and display code output within the notebook.

Data Science: A field that often utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for creating reports, results, notes, and teaching materials. The interactive nature of the notebooks allows students or collaborators to easily experiment with code and learn from the provided materials.
