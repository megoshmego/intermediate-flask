- [Instructor] All right, welcome back.
0:06
Next up.
0:06
We've got a pretty quick sub unit talking about,
0:09
using external APIs from a flask application
0:13
and also just making requests from Python in general.
0:16
Back when we covered Axios and Ajax,
0:18
we saw how we can make a request from the browser,
0:21
but sometimes we also wanna make API requests from Python
0:25
or from whatever our server is written in,
0:27
whether it's Node or Ruby or Python.
0:30
It's pretty common that we have some data
0:31
we want to get on the server side.
0:35
So let's compare the approaches.
0:37
One option to talk with an API is to make a request
0:39
from JavaScript from the browser using Ajax.
0:43
Well, usually a library these days,
0:45
like Axios or at the very least
0:47
a tool like fetch built into the browser.
0:50
But we also have server-side requests
0:52
which are made on the server side,
0:53
so they're not made from the browser.
0:56
Just like I can make a request with curl from my machine.
0:58
I can make a request using Python.
1:00
I can make a request to load iTunes data or Pokemon data
1:04
or recent Tweets.
1:06
And there's a lot of reasons I might wanna do this.
1:09
So here's a diagram of a client side request.
1:12
Let's say here's a simple flask application,
1:14
we have set up our server, we have a database
1:17
and then we have the browser where a user
1:19
is requesting some page from our server.
1:22
And then we probably get some information from our database
1:26
and then we can respond to the browser,
1:28
the client with a HTML CSS and JavaScript.
1:32
And then we can have some JavaScript in that browser
1:35
that makes a request to some API like the Pok√©mon API
1:38
or the iTunes API.
1:40
And then that API respond to something
1:42
and then JavaScript does something,
1:44
maybe it adds something to the page.
1:46
It removes something from the Dom, it shows the results.
1:50
This is your typical client side request workflow.
1:54
Really the client side request is just happening here.
1:56
Can ignore all of this.
1:58
It's just the browser making a request to an external API
2:01
and getting something back.
2:03
Also, I should note here
2:05
that we can also respond with JavaScript to a browser.
2:08
So to the client side, some HTML and CSS,
2:11
and JavaScript from a flask application
2:14
that then makes Ajax requests back to our server.
2:17
That's something we'll talk a little bit more about
2:19
in the next sub unit.
2:20
When we talk about JSON and RESTful APIs.
2:23
So we can do this very easily from the browser,
2:25
make a request and JavaScript to some external API.
2:28
There's no flask involved at that point.
2:30
It's just Java script, making requests,
2:32
getting something back.
2:34
This can be faster, but there are limitations.
2:37
So why would we do this?
2:39
Why would we make a request from the server side?
2:41
Here's our flask server, here's our database,
2:44
here's the browser and here's an external API
2:47
where through Python, we might request something.
2:50
So let's say we're working with the iTunes
2:52
or the Pokemon API, from my flask server.
2:56
Let's say the user hits some end point
2:58
like Slash list or Pokemon.
3:01
My flask Python code can send a request to Pokemon api.com,
3:06
get results back,
3:08
and then use those results to make a template or even save
3:09
them to the database, just to do something via Python,
3:14
to respond to my browser with.
3:16
So that requests logic is happening
3:17
on the server side of things.
3:19
Right here is a line between client and server
3:22
versus over here,
3:24
the line is kind of a diagonal line right here.
3:28
Purple is server side and blue is client side.
3:31
So why would we do this?
3:33
Well, certain APIs are set up so that you have to do it.
3:36
You don't have a choice.
3:38
If you tried to make a request to an API
3:40
that enforces the same origin policy
3:42
or has strict restrictions,
3:44
you won't be able to actually request that from Ajax.
3:48
But what we can do is set up a route
3:50
in our flask application.
3:53
Let's just say,
3:53
hypothetically Reddit's API
3:56
is not gonna work through Ajax,
3:58
so we can set up a route in our flask server
4:01
that will make a request from the server side
4:03
to read its API.
4:05
And we can request that route from the browser.
4:07
So it's kind of like a game of telephone.
4:09
The browser says, please,
4:11
I want the Reddit information to our foster server.
4:14
The first server says, okay, hang on.
4:15
We gonna go get it.
4:16
It makes the request to read its API that responds back.
4:20
And then the flask server
4:22
doesn't even have to respond with a template.
4:23
It can just respond back to Ajax needed.
4:26
So we could have an Ajax request
4:27
that would not work to go directly to an external API.
4:31
Instead, we could send it to our server.
4:33
The server does the external API
4:35
and then that ping pongs back to our Ajax in the browser.
4:39
But other reasons include
4:41
a lot of the time you want to do something
4:43
that you can only do server side,
4:45
like if we want to involve our database
4:47
and I want to get, I don't know,
4:49
a hundred Pokemon from the API and put them in my database.
4:53
I have a Pokemon model from SQLAlchemy,
4:56
or when we register a user and we ask for their zip code,
4:59
maybe I wanna take that zip code
5:01
and get a Longitude Latitude from an API.
5:04
There are APIs that will do this,
5:06
and I could send that over.
5:08
What's the Longitude Latitude
5:09
for 10003, the API responds
5:13
and then I can save that to my database.
5:16
So that's something I would do on the server side.
5:18
Also a really important one is that a lot of these APIs
5:22
that you probably care about,
5:23
a lot of the fancier, Twitter,
5:27
Facebook, API APIs, LinkedIn's API,
5:30
pretty much any of the API from big companies, Spotify,
5:33
where you can actually do things like
5:36
create a new Twitter post, a Tweet,
5:38
I guess that's what it's called
5:40
or update information about a user
5:43
or get authenticated information.
5:45
Like, somebody's friends that are private.
5:48
Those APIs are now just open for everyone to use.
5:51
They have a lot more restrictions
5:53
and you need a password, an API key.
5:56
You need to be authenticated a lot of the time.
5:59
And we can't really do that from the browser
6:01
because everyone can see every request
6:03
that we send from the browser.
6:04
We've seen that in the dev tools.
6:06
But if we instead make the request from our server,
6:09
anybody who's actually viewing our website is not gonna
6:12
be able to see that request happening.
6:14
They might see an Ajax request to the server that says,
6:16
please make a new tweet/new tweet.
6:20
But then the server actually does that API call
6:23
and sends the password along with the information
6:27
to Twitter's API which requires a password.
6:30
So that is a really common reason also
6:32
to do server-side requests.
6:34
And we'll actually see a simple example of this
6:37
using a geocoding API,
6:39
and just a bit,
6:40
geocoding means taking a human readable address
6:44
or States or location like the golden gate bridge
6:48
and converting it into Longitude Latitude,
6:49
So you can display it on a map
6:51
or store that in your database.
6:53
So we'll be using an API that does require an API key,
6:56
and we don't want everyone to be able to see
6:58
that key in the browser.
7:00
All right, so there are important distinctions here
7:03
between these two approaches,
7:04
but what they have in common
7:06
is just the fact that it's an HTTP request being made,
7:09
whether it's coming from Python or Ruby or Node.js or Java,
7:13
it doesn't matter.
7:14
It's just a request.
7:16
Or if it's coming from the browser, it's just a request,
7:18
but there are these important considerations
7:20
around things like your API keys.
7:24
Does it need to come from the server side
7:25
so that a user can actually see that API key?
7:28
Is there a, an issue,
7:29
a same origin issue where the API
7:31
is not going to allow us to make an Ajax request?
7:34
These are all things to ask yourself.
7:36
And often, especially with same origin,
7:39
I just try and use Ajax a lot of the time to start
7:42
and then realized it's not gonna work.
7:43
So then I make a route in my server where I can relay
7:46
that requests and make a server-side API call
7:49
and then send that back to the browser.
7:51
Anyway, we'll see some examples of this and just a bit,
7:55
we're gonna start by learning
7:56
how we make a simple request using Python.
