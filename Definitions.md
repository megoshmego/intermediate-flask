Nested Routes: A routing technique used in web development when one resource is associated with another resource. For example, if you have subreddits and posts, you may want to have a nested route to show the posts associated with a specific subreddit.

Avoid deep nesting: A rule of thumb to avoid nesting routes more than two resources deep to maintain simplicity and readability of the URLs.

Flexibility: The freedom to structure nested routes according to the requirements of your API. There's no strict rule for structuring nested routes, and depending on your API's needs, you may decide to include or exclude certain resource IDs in the URL.

RESTful routes: A standardized approach to designing networked applications, based on the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). RESTful routes follow a specific pattern that includes HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and specific URL structures, defining how resources should be created, read, updated, and deleted.

WTForms-Alchemy: A Flask add-on that combines WTForms and SQLAlchemy to generate forms directly based on your SQLAlchemy model, automatically creating validators based on model constraints. It speeds up development on larger projects.

Bcrypt: A password hashing algorithm that combines the Blowfish cipher with another password algorithm called crypt. It is considered safe, popular, and has implementations in many programming languages.

Salt: A random string used in conjunction with a password when hashing it to create a unique hash output. This prevents the use of precomputed tables, such as rainbow tables, for reversing hashes back into passwords.

Work Factor: A parameter in the Bcrypt algorithm that specifies the number of rounds of hashing to perform. Increasing the work factor makes the hash slower to compute, making it more resistant to brute force attacks.

Binary String: A string representation of binary data used in programming languages, such as Python. In Python, binary strings are indicated by the prefix "b".

Hashing: The process of converting an input, such as a password, into a fixed-size output, which is the hash. This process should be deterministic, meaning that the same input should always generate the same hash.

Authentication: The process of verifying a user's identity by checking if the password they provide matches the stored hash in the database. This is done by hashing the provided password with the stored salt and comparing the output to the stored hash.

JSON API: A JSON API is an application programming interface that uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for exchanging data between a server and a client.

Safe: In the context of HTTP requests, a safe operation is one that does not change the data being requested. Among the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE), only the GET request is considered safe.

Idempotent: In the context of HTTP requests, an idempotent operation is one that can be repeated multiple times with the same result. The following HTTP verbs are considered idempotent: GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE (although DELETE can be a bit tricky).

GET request: A safe and idempotent operation that retrieves data from a specified resource.

POST request: A non-idempotent operation that submits data to be processed to a specified resource, usually resulting in the creation of a new resource. Each time a POST request is sent, a new resource is created, making it non-idempotent.

PUT request: An idempotent operation that updates an existing resource with new data. Repeating the operation multiple times will have the same effect as performing it once.

PATCH request: An idempotent operation that partially updates an existing resource with new data. Similar to PUT, repeating the operation multiple times will have the same effect as performing it once.

DELETE request: An idempotent operation that deletes a specified resource. Although it is considered idempotent, DELETE can be tricky, as the resource is removed, and further requests for the same resource may result in errors or different responses.

REST (Representational State Transfer): A set of architectural principles and guidelines for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs follow these guidelines and make use of HTTP verbs to indicate the desired action on a resource.

User Authentication: Users are authenticated by checking their submitted credentials against stored user data in the database. The class method user.authenticate is used to achieve this.
Storing User ID in the Session: When a user logs in successfully, their user ID is stored in the session, which can then be used to determine if the user is logged in or not.
Displaying Content Based on User Status: Based on the presence of the user ID in the session, you can show or hide content in your templates or control access to certain routes.
Protecting Routes: You can add logic to your view functions to ensure that only logged-in users can access certain routes. If a user is not logged in, you can redirect them to a different page

Generator object: An iterator that is returned when a generator function is called, allowing you to iterate over a sequence of values.

Laziness: A term used to describe the process of generating values only when they are needed, instead of generating all values at once. Generators implement lazy evaluation, which can save memory and improve performance.

Iterators: Objects that allow you to iterate over a collection of values, such as lists, tuples, or strings. Generators are a type of iterator in Python.

StopIteration exception: This exception is raised when the generator reaches the end of its iteration. It signals to the loop or other iterable construct that there are no more values to be generated.

Jupyter: A popular tool in the world of Python, allowing for the creation of interactive documents that can run code, edit code, display code output, create charts, and add documentation, all within a webpage.

1. Flask Sessions: Flask sessions are used to persist information and add state on top of the HTTP protocol, which is stateless by default. They are crucial for remembering if a user is logged in or not.

2. User Authentication: Users are authenticated by checking their submitted credentials against stored user data in the database. The class method `user.authenticate` is used to achieve this.

3. Storing User ID in the Session: When a user logs in successfully, their user ID is stored in the session, which can then be used to determine if the user is logged in or not.

5. Protecting Routes: You can add logic to your view functions to ensure that only logged-in users can access certain routes. If a user is not logged in, you can redirect them to a different page or show an error message.

6. Logging Out: To log a user out, you simply remove their user ID from the session using `session.pop('user_id')`. This will make the user appear as not logged in, and they will lose access to protected content.

7. Associating User with Models: To associate a user with a particular model (e.g., a comment or a post), you can use the user ID stored in the session. This allows you to show the correct content to users and implement features like allowing only the owner of a comment to delete it.

These concepts are essential for building an effective user authentication system and controlling access to content based on a user's login status. By using Flask sessions and the techniques discussed, you can create dynamic web applications that adapt to the user's authentication state.

Sure, here's a simple Flask application that demonstrates user registration, login, logout, and protected routes using Flask sessions.

Built-in hash function: A function available in Python that accepts an input and generates a hash value without requiring any imports. This function is not suitable for storing passwords due to various reasons.

64-bit space: The built-in hash function in Python maps the input to a 64-bit space, which means it uses 64 bits in memory to store the hash value.

Consistent hash values: The built-in hash function will generate the same hash value for a given input in the same implementation of Python, but the output may differ depending on the architecture, machine, and specific build of Python.

Collisions: Hash functions may generate the same hash value for different inputs. The built-in hash function in Python is relatively prone to collisions compared to other cryptographic hash functions.

Fast vs. slow hash functions: A fast hash function is not suitable for password storage, as it enables attackers to brute force their way through the hash values. Cryptographic hash functions are designed to be slow to provide better security.

Hash maps: A data structure that uses a hash function for implementation. Python dictionaries are an example of hash maps. Hash maps are fast for data retrieval and insertion, regardless of the number of key-value pairs.

Hashable and non-hashable keys: In Python dictionaries, keys must be hashable. Mutable types, such as lists, are non-hashable, while immutable types, such as numbers, strings, and booleans, can be hashed.

The built-in hash function in Python is not suitable for storing passwords due to its smaller output space (64 bits), faster computation, and higher collision probability. However, it is used in Python dictionaries, which are examples of hash maps. Dictionaries are fast and efficient for data retrieval and insertion. The keys in dictionaries must be hashable, which means they must be immutable data types.
