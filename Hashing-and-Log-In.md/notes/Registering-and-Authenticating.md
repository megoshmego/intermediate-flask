Key Terms, Ideas, and Concepts:

1. Flask Bcrypt: A Flask extension that provides bcrypt hashing utilities for a Flask application.
2. Hashing: A process of converting plain text data into a fixed-size, unreadable string of characters, which is usually a unique representation of the data.
3. Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user by comparing their provided credentials against stored user data.
4. User model: A data structure representing a user in the application, with fields like ID, username, and password.
5. Protected route: A route in a Flask application that requires user authentication to access.
6. Redirects: Changing the user's current URL to another URL in response to certain actions or conditions.
7. Class method: A method that's bound to a class and not an instance of the object, typically used for operations that don't require a specific instance of the class to work with.
8. Session: A way to store user-specific data on the server-side during a user's interaction with a web application.
9. Password hashing: A technique used to securely store user passwords in a database, making it difficult for attackers to retrieve the original password if the database is compromised.




Certainly! Here's an example of a simple feedforward neural network using Python and the popular deep learning library TensorFlow (Keras). This example demonstrates how to create a neural network for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

First, you need to install TensorFlow:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

Now you can create your neural network:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

# Load the MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28*28).astype("float32") / 255.0
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28*28).astype("float32") / 255.0

# One-hot encode the labels
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)

# Create the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(28*28,)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10, validation_split=0.1)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test loss: {loss}, Test accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This code demonstrates how to:

1. Load the MNIST dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (reshape and normalize).
3. One-hot encode the labels.
4. Create a feedforward neural network model.
5. Compile the model with an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.
6. Train the model on the training data.
7. Evaluate the model on the test data.

This example should help you become familiar with the basic steps of creating, training, and evaluating a neural network using TensorFlow (Keras). You can build upon this foundation to develop more advanced neural networks and tackle more complex tasks as you progress in your AI SWE career.
