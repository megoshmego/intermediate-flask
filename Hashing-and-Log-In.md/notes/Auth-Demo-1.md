Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the transcript of the video "Authorization demo 1 - Hashing and login - Intermediate Flask" evaluated for its key terms, ideas, concepts, and their definitions, as well as any demonstrations or other related content you believe would be helpful learning that material.

Key terms:
Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user.
Authorization: The process of determining what a user is allowed to do.
Hashing: A cryptographic function that takes an input of any length and produces an output of a fixed length.
Session: A temporary state associated with a user.
Bcrypt: A password hashing function that is designed to be slow to compute.
Ideas and concepts:
Authentication and authorization are two important security concepts that are essential for protecting user data.
Hashing is a technique that can be used to protect passwords.
Sessions are a way to store state information for a user across multiple requests.
Bcrypt is a secure password hashing function that is recommended for use in production applications.
Demonstrations or other related content:
The video demonstrates how to implement authentication and authorization in a Flask application.
The video also demonstrates how to use hashing to protect passwords.
The video also demonstrates how to use sessions to store state information for a user.
I hope this is helpful!
