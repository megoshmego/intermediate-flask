Video Title: Authentication-Authorization
Section Title: Intermediate Flask
Subsection Title: Hashing and Logging In

Key terms, ideas, and concepts:

Authentication: Verifying that someone is who they claim to be based on their provided credentials, such as email and password or username and password. It enables users to sign up for an account and log in or log out of an application.

Authorization: Managing permissions once a user is authenticated. It dictates what actions a user is allowed to perform, such as creating or deleting comments or accessing certain pages within an application. Authorization varies depending on the user's role or status, such as regular users, moderators, or administrators.

Hashing: A method used to securely store passwords by transforming them into fixed-length strings of characters. This process ensures that even if a hacker gains access to a database, they cannot easily reverse-engineer the passwords. Hashing algorithms like Bcrypt are commonly used for this purpose.

Bcrypt: A password hashing algorithm used for securely storing passwords. It is recommended for use in Flask applications and will be implemented in the video series for authentication and authorization.

Security: The practice of protecting sensitive information, such as user passwords, from unauthorized access. It involves storing hashed passwords instead of plain text passwords and implementing secure authentication and authorization methods.

Roles and Permissions: Different levels of access within an application, depending on a user's status or role. Examples include regular users, moderators, and administrators, each with varying levels of authorization to perform actions within the application.

In the video, the instructor introduces the concepts of authentication and authorization and explains their differences. They provide examples using Reddit, where users need to sign up and log in (authenticate) to perform actions and are limited in their actions based on their roles and permissions (authorize). The video also briefly mentions hashing and the Bcrypt algorithm, which will be covered in more depth later in the series. The instructor warns that the next video will demonstrate a bad way of implementing authentication, serving as a cautionary example before discussing the proper way to do it.
