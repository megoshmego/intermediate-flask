Key Terms, Ideas, Concepts and Definitions:

1. Python hash function: A built-in Python function for generating hash values, which is not suitable for hashing and storing passwords.

2. Password hashing algorithms: Recommended algorithms for hashing passwords, such as Bcrypt. These algorithms have been extensively researched and are considered secure for password storage.

3. Bcrypt: A popular password hashing algorithm that is considered secure and widely used in the industry.

4. Reverse lookup table: A table or dictionary that maps the hash values to their corresponding passwords. This can be used by attackers to find passwords by looking up the hash values.

5. Salting or password salts: A random string that is introduced before hashing the password. This adds an extra layer of security by making it much harder for an attacker to generate a reverse lookup table or use precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) for cracking passwords.

6. Rainbow table: A more sophisticated version of a reverse lookup table, which is also used by attackers to crack passwords.

7. Collision: A situation in which two different inputs to a hash function produce the same output. Salting helps to reduce the likelihood of collisions.

8. Cryptographic hash functions: Hash functions that are designed to be secure for cryptographic purposes, such as password storage. Bcrypt is an example of a cryptographic hash function.

In the video, the instructor explains the importance of using a secure password hashing algorithm like Bcrypt and not using Python's built-in hash function for password storage. The concept of salting is introduced to add an extra layer of security and make it harder for attackers to crack passwords using reverse lookup tables or rainbow tables. The instructor demonstrates how salting works and discusses the benefits of using salts in password hashing. Finally, the video sets the stage for the upcoming discussion on Bcrypt and cryptographic hash functions.

Certainly! I will provide a Python code example for hashing a password using Bcrypt and Flask, and then verifying it. This will give you a practical demonstration of password hashing and verification that you can use as a reference in your career.

First, you need to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install Flask bcrypt
```

Now, let's create a simple Flask application that demonstrates how to hash and verify passwords using Bcrypt:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt

app = Flask(__name__)
bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)

@app.route('/hash', methods=['POST'])
def hash_password():
    password = request.form['password']
    hashed_password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(password).decode('utf-8')
    return {'hashed_password': hashed_password}

@app.route('/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_password():
    password = request.form['password']
    hashed_password = request.form['hashed_password']

    if bcrypt.check_password_hash(hashed_password, password):
        return {'result': 'Password is correct'}
    else:
        return {'result': 'Password is incorrect'}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, we have two Flask routes:

1. `/hash`: Takes a password from the request form data and returns its hashed version using Bcrypt.
2. `/verify`: Takes a password and its hashed version from the request form data, and checks if they match. Returns a message indicating whether the password is correct or incorrect.

To test this application, you can use an API client like Postman or curl, or even create a simple HTML form to interact with the server.

Remember, this example is for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world application, you would integrate this functionality into your user authentication system, and never expose the `/hash` and `/verify` routes directly.
