Key terms, ideas, and concepts:

Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system.
Hashing: The process of converting data (in this case, a password) into a fixed-length string of characters, which is difficult to reverse-engineer.
Salting: Adding random data to a password before hashing, to increase security and prevent dictionary attacks.
Bcrypt, SHA, MD5: Different hashing algorithms used for password security.
Security vulnerability: A weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or control.
Plain text password storage: Storing users' passwords in an unencrypted format, which is a bad practice and leads to security vulnerabilities.
Password comparison: Comparing the user's input password with the stored password in the database to authenticate the user.
Password reuse: The practice of using the same password for multiple websites or services, which is discouraged for security reasons.
Password manager: A tool that helps users create, store, and manage strong, unique passwords for each website or service they use.
Two-factor authentication: An extra layer of security that requires a user to provide two different types of identification, such as a password and a fingerprint or a one-time code sent to their phone.
In the video, the narrator demonstrates a poor way of implementing authentication by storing plain text passwords in a database. The narrator emphasizes the importance of not storing passwords in plain text due to the risks of unauthorized access, password reuse, and potential damage to users' accounts on other websites. The narrator also highlights how this method is easier to implement but is not secure and should not be used. The importance of using proper hashing and salting techniques for storing passwords securely is stressed as a best practice.

As requested, here's a simple demonstration of how to properly store and verify hashed passwords using Flask and the werkzeug library, which includes password hashing functions:

First, install the Flask and Werkzeug libraries, if you haven't already:
Copy code
pip install Flask
pip install Werkzeug
Now, create a simple Flask app with proper password hashing and verification:
python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

app = Flask(__name__)

# In a real-world application, you should use a database to store user data.
users = {
    "example_user": {
        "username": "example_user",
        "password": generate_password_hash("example_password"),
    }
}

@app.route("/register", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def register():
    if request.method == "POST":
        username = request.form["username"]
        password = request.form["password"]
        password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)
        users[username] = {
            "username": username,
            "password": password_hash,
        }
        return f"User {username} registered successfully!"
    return render_template_string('''
        <form method="post">
            <label for="username">Username:</label>
            <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br>
            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br>
            <input type="submit" value="Register">
        </form>
    ''')

@app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    error = None
    if request.method == "POST":
        username = request.form["username"]
        password = request.form["password"]
        user = users.get(username)
        if user and check_password_hash(user["password"], password):
            return f"Welcome, {username}! You have successfully logged in."
        else:
            error = "Invalid username or password."
    return render_template_string('''
        {% if error %}
            <p><strong>{{ error }}</strong></p>
        {% endif %}
        <form method="post">
            <label for="username">Username:</label>
            <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br>
            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br>
            <input type="submit" value="Login">
        </form>
    ''', error=error)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
This example demonstrates how to use the generate_password_hash function to store hashed passwords and the check_password_hash function to verify user-entered passwords against the stored hashes.

Please note that this example uses an in-memory Python dictionary (users) to store user data. In a real-world application, you would use a database for this purpose.
